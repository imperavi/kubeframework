# Kube CSS Framework

## What is Kube

Kube ("kyu:b") is a web framework for developers and designers alike. 
Kube is built and designed to provide the most flexible yet powerful CSS & JS framework to the community. 
Unlike many other web frameworks, Kube is great for both super-fast bootstrapping and for a serious cutting edge, future-proof web development.
